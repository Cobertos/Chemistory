### Deploy

**Firebase** - We use firebase for test builds right now, it's configured to deploy `dist/*` right now

* Make sure node and npm are installed
* Download `npm install -g firebase-tools`
* Run `firebase deploy`

### TODO:

* Add build info, short instructions/description, current bugs, changelog, into the window so playertests/users/friends can have a better look at what's going on
